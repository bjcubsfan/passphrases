### Generate passphrases to use as passwords

I was inspired by [xkcd][xkcd-comic] to make a easy-to-use,
program that generates high quality passphrases that users can be
confident to use for their passwords, as I have.

## install and run

Simply clone this repository and then run passphrases:

    python passphrases.py

You could put a link in your $PATH to run this easily whenever you need
a new password. That's what I do.

This program was written by [@bjcubsfan][bjcubsfan]. You can also
contact me at bjp.passphrases@xoxy.net.
